# Transformer Image Generation

**Transformer Image Generation** is a project that explores the application of Transformer Neural Networks for image generation tasks. Leveraging the self-attention mechanism inherent in Transformers, this approach aims to capture complex dependencies in image data, facilitating the generation of coherent and high-quality images.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a Transformer-based model tailored for image generation. By treating images as sequences of patches, the model learns to generate images by predicting pixel values in an autoregressive manner, capturing both local and global structures effectively.
